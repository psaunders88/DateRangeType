# Date Range Type

A simple symfony form type for managing date ranges

Not long after starting this I found a similar but better written component in the SonataCorebundle here(https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataCoreBundle/blob/master/Form/Type/DateRangeType.php)
As I result I corrected my solution to be more similar.
